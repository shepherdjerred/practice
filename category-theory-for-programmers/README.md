# category-theory-for-programmers

My solutions to challenges in [Category Theory for Programmers](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf).

Many of my solutions use GraphViz to render graphs. The source and output are usually included. [GraphViz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) is an easy way to view/edit these graphs. My solutions in the Java programming language were writting using JDK 11.
