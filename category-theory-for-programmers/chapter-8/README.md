# Functoriality

    Show that the data type:

    data Pair a b = Pair a b

    is a bifunctor. For additional credit implement all three methods of Bifunctor and use equational reasoning to show that these definitions are compatible with the default implementations whenever they can be applied.
    Show the isomorphism between the standard definition of Maybe and this desugaring:

    type Maybe' a = Either (Const () a) (Identity a)

    Hint: Define two mappings between the two implementations. For additional credit, show that they are the inverse of each other using equational reasoning.
    Let’s try another data structure. I call it a PreList because it’s a precursor to a List. It replaces recursion with a type parameter b.

    data PreList a b = Nil | Cons a b

    You could recover our earlier definition of a List by recursively applying PreList to itself (we’ll see how it’s done when we talk about fixed points).

    Show that PreList is an instance of Bifunctor.
    Show that the following data types define bifunctors in a and b:

    data K2 c a b = K2 c

    data Fst a b = Fst a

    data Snd a b = Snd b

    For additional credit, check your solutions agains Conor McBride’s paper Clowns to the Left of me, Jokers to the Right.
    Define a bifunctor in a language other than Haskell. Implement bimap for a generic pair in that language.
    Should std::map be considered a bifunctor or a profunctor in the two template arguments Key and T? How would you redesign this data type to make it so?
